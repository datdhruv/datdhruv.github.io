To quickly search through, or re-run one of the previously run command, especially if it is a long one, instead of searching the `.hist` file, you can just type `ctrl r` and that will bring up a reverse/back search prompt where it will try to autocomplete the previously run command.

The command search from most recently used first, so if the first suggestion is not the command you want, you can keep going back and searching by repeatedly typing `ctrl r`
