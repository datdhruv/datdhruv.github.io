# Double and single Quotes in (PG)SQL

Double quotes are for names of tables or fields. Sometimes You can omit them. The single quotes are for string constants. This is the SQL standard. In the verbose form, your query looks like this:

```sql
select * from "employee" where "employee_name"='elina';
```


# The PSQL Command

To get help, just type \help in the psql console.

You can also get help about the various psql commands if you type in `\?` into the psql console. Or you can also get help regarding various Postgres commands if you input \h into the console.
