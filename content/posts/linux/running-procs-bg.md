Imagine a situation where you need to download a large file from the internet to a remote server.

You run `curl https://download.com -o download` and logout of the ssh server. **Big mistake!** you come back hours later just to see that the download ended as soon as you logged out.

The `nohup` command helps here. `nohup` stands for no hold up, and will run the command without any external interruptions. you can further run the command in the background using `&`.

Here's the example:

``` bash
$ nohup curl https://download.com -o download &
```
