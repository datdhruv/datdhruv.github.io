When using a laptop as a server, if the SSH connection is laggy, it may be because of a wireless cardâ€™s power-saving feature.

You can turn this feature off by issuing the command

`iw <devname> set power_save off`

You can view the status of iw using the command

`iw <devname> get power_save`

and the device name `<devname>` using the command `ip a`

iw is used to show / manipulate wireless devices and their configuration
