This is relatively an easy task with vscode. You just open the search in files menu, type what you are looking for, and off you go.
This made me wonder, how would you achieve this task in the command line with something like grep?
There is an amazing tool which specializes in this activity: ripgrep, however I was determined to complete this task with just grep.</description></item><item><title>Regex concepts</title><link>https://dhruv.ing/posts/misc/regex-concepts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 12:00:00 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://dhruv.ing/posts/misc/regex-concepts/</guid><description>Regex Concepts To escape characters you need to use \ escape characters, for eg if you want to search for a &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&amp;quot;, use backslash \., \?, \\. If you want to search for an email address eg: name@example.com, use: name@example\.com
. -&amp;gt; matches any character except newline character
\d matches digits (anything from 0-9)
\D matches anything BUT a digit
\w searches for any alphanumeric character (a-z,A-Z,0-9)</description></item></channel></rss>
