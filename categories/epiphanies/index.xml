&lt;p>Most of the usage of this kind of work will be via the terminal itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am however still struggling with how to use desktop linux, so as to be that one guy who propogates Linux use on the desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows is used everywhere, and admittedly it is much easier to set some stuff like virtualbox up, and get working fast, so that complicates the issue further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also want to use Linux, because I am really comfortable with how it works and I know in depth how it &lt;strong>might&lt;/strong> work, or how things might be set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Think of the Desktop OS as a frontend, and Linux as the backend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The frontend has different set of goals, outcomes and expectations whereas the backend has it&amp;rsquo;s own goals, outcomes and expectations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And in any scenario, you will be accessing most tools through the terminal, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what you frontend you use.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well, in any case, you can always download a virtualization platform and run it on linux!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, some time ago I had issues running qbittorrent on windows. It would be flagged by the antivirus and would be uninstalled immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And alternative to this &lt;em>restriction&lt;/em> is to just install qbittorrent in a Linux VM and get what you want with that. It is a heavier alternative, but well it is &lt;em>an&lt;/em> alternative!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
