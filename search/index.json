[{"content":"What is Port Forwarding? Port Forwarding allows you to make a port on a computer behave like it is part of some other computer.\nSay you are running a website on a computer A, on localhost:8080, you can forward this port to another computer B and then any connection to computer-B:8080 will be tunneled back to computer A.\nThis was an example of local port forwarding.\nYou can go the other way round as well, having a website run on computer-B:8080 and tunnel it to the Computer A. This is called remote port forwarding.\nA little more Explanation Let us consider the \u0026ldquo;tunnel\u0026rdquo;.\nThe tunnel has a start and an end and the traffic is tunneled from start to end.\nWhen the tunnel ends at our local Machine host, it\u0026rsquo;s called a local port forward (Tunnel ends at Local port) whereas when the tunnel starts at local port \u0026amp; ends at the remote port it\u0026rsquo;s called remote port forwarding\nThe first IP is for specifying access.\nWho has access? localhost or anyone on the network?\nWhile in local port forwarding, you can have a setup wherein only you, on your own machine can access this website. There can be another arrangement wherein you can allow others on your network to access the tunnel/local port forward. In this situation they will access it via yourip:forward-binded-port\nSame for remote. If an ip is specified then only access to remote tunnel. No other ip on the network can access this IP address.\nWhen you use the -L flag, you can bind the remote port to the local port and listen to incoming connections on that port\n1 2 3 4 -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport -L [bind_address:]port:remote_socket -L local_socket:host:hostport -L local_socket:remote_socket Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the local (client) host are to be forwarded to the given host and port, or Unix socket, on the remote side. This works by allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP port on the local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address, or to a Unix socket. Whenever a connection is made to the local port or socket, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to either host port hostport, or the Unix socket remote_socket, from the remote machine.\nPort forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.\nBy default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting. However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection to a specific address. The bind_address of localhost indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or * indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.\nIf remote port forwarding does not work, it is most likely because GatewayPorts is set to no in the sshd_config file.\nRemember, in local port forwarding, A request to my computer\u0026rsquo;s port is forwarded to a remote computer\u0026rsquo;s port and in remote port forwarding, requests to a remote computer\u0026rsquo;s port are forwarded to my computer\u0026rsquo;s port.\nThis means that the meaning of host varies depending upon if the the port forwarding is local or remote. In local port forwarding, the host is the ssh-server. Whereas in remote port forwarding the host is the ssh-client (host is the one which hosts something on a port)\nYou can further forward ports through jump servers.\n1 ssh -L local_socket:host:hostport user@machine1 ssh -L local_socket:host:hostport user@machine2 Forwarding with an already established ssh connection Note: ~ is the escape sequence for ssh by default. If it doesnt work immediately, you may need to press enter once and the try entering ~\n~ C Brings up a (local) ssh shell, wherein you can then ask for port forwarding the same way we did earlier.\n1 2 -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport Further you can stop the port forwarding Enter the ssh command mode, then input the forwarding command with a leading K\n1 2 -KL [bind_address:]port -KR [bind_address:]port ","date":"2021-05-19T12:00:00+04:00","permalink":"https://datdhruv.github.io/p/why-ssh-port-forwarding-gives-you-superpowers/","title":"Why SSH port Forwarding gives you superpowers"},{"content":"Some Conventions\nrepository(repo) -\u0026gt; basically just a folder, which has all your code in it\nlocal repo -\u0026gt; The folder that is On your computer\nremote repo -\u0026gt; The folder that is on some git server (or on a server, basically not on your computer)\norigin is the git repo, master is the branch of the repo you want to push to.\nBefore we proceed, please also check the help pages and the man pages for the topics, they go beyond these basics and explaing in more depth\nTo initialize a local repository 1 git init \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt; if you create a directory on a remote and initialize with git init . and then try commiting to it, it wont happen!\non the remote you need to git checkout -b tmp and then push from your machine(local) to the remote\nhere is a stackoverflow page\nI just had the same error while I began learning Git. Some of the other answers are clearly not for someone new to Git!\n(I am going to use non technical terms to get the idea across.) Anyway, what is happening is that you have two repositories, one is the original you first made, and the other the work one you just made.\nRight now you are in your work repository and are using the \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; branch. But you also happen to be \u0026ldquo;logged in\u0026rdquo; in your original repository to the same \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; branch. Now since you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;logged in\u0026rdquo; in the original, Git fears you might mess up because you might be working on the original and screw things up.

For eg to match al characters that are not a lower case letter: [^a-z]\nQuantifiers: matching more than one character at a time matches 0 or more instances matches 1 or more ? matches 0 or one instances {} matches exact numbers. eg a{3} -\u0026gt; a three times works same for \\d \\s \\w stuffs {num1, num2} matches an range of numbers and follows {min, max} range. eg a{1,3} one to three repetitions of a. works same for \\d \\s \\w stuffs Groups: allows us to specify different matches groups are defined using parenthesis ()\nfor eg: to match Mr, Ms, Mrs:\nM(r|s|rs)\npipe operator (|) is used to for \u0026ldquo;OR\u0026rdquo; in groups\nBack references the values in groups are stored in something called back groups.\nin vscode you can call them with $grpnum (eg $2) to replace them in replace mode in \u0026ldquo;find\u0026rdquo;\nhowever usually it is \\num eg \\2 for group 2\nExamples matching phone numbers 321-555-4321\n123.555.1234\nsoln -\u0026gt; \\d\\d\\d\\W\\d\\d\\d\\W\\d\\d\\d\\d, dig dig dig non-whitespace dig\u0026hellip;..\ncharacter matching\ncat\nmat\npat\nbat\nmatch everything except bat\n[^b]at\nIn Python remember to convert the string containing regular expressions to raw form: eg r\u0026quot;hello\u0026quot;. This is done so that python does not take expressions with a leading backslash and escape sequesces of it\u0026rsquo;s own.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 import re urls = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;for groups match.group(grp_num) eg match.group(3) \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Substitutions subbed_urls = pattern.sub(r\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) ","date":"2020-01-05T12:00:00+04:00","permalink":"https://datdhruv.github.io/p/regex-concepts/","title":"Regex concepts"},{"content":"Installing Kali linux on Raspberry Pi Flash the image on to the sd card (I recommend using balena etcher) Before putting the SD card into the pi, in the boot folder, create a ssh file (just touch ssh in the boot folder) now come the more tricky part. connect the pi to the router (with a wire) and then ssh into it. use nmtui to to set up the network now you have to enable ssh at each subsequent boot.

It would be flagged by the antivirus and would be uninstalled immediately.\nAnd alternative to this restriction is to just install qbittorrent in a Linux VM and get what you want with that.
